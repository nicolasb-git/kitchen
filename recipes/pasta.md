### Ingredients
- [ ] 1 lb Fettuccine or Tagliatelle
- [ ] 2 tbsp Olive Oil
- [ ] 1 lb Mixed Wild Mushrooms
- [ ] 3 cloves Garlic, minced
- [ ] 1 cup Heavy Cream
- [ ] 1/2 cup Parmesan Cheese
- [ ] Fresh Parsley, chopped
- [ ] Salt and Black Pepper

### Instructions
1. **Prepare the Mushrooms**
   Clean the mushrooms with a damp cloth and slice them. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until golden brown and moisture has evaporated, about 8-10 minutes.

2. **Cook the Pasta**
   While mushrooms are cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining.

3. **Make the Sauce**
   Reduce heat to medium. Add minced garlic to the mushrooms and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant. Pour in the heavy cream and simmer for 2-3 minutes until slightly thickened.

4. **Combine and Serve**
   Stir in the parmesan cheese. Add the drained pasta to the skillet along with a splash of reserved pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce. Toss to coat evenly. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve immediately.
