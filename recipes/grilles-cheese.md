### Ingredients
- [ ] 2 slices Bread (white, sourdough, or your choice)
- [ ] 2 tbsp Butter, softened
- [ ] 2-3 slices Cheese (cheddar, American, or Gruyère)
- [ ] Optional: pinch of Garlic Powder
- [ ] Optional: pinch of Black Pepper

### Instructions
1. **Butter the Bread**
   Spread softened butter evenly on one side of each bread slice, making sure to cover all the way to the edges. This ensures even browning and prevents sticking.

2. **Assemble the Sandwich**
   Place one slice of bread butter-side down on a plate. Layer the cheese slices on top. If using optional seasonings, sprinkle them on the cheese. Top with the second bread slice, butter-side up.

3. **Cook Low and Slow**
   Heat a skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. Place the sandwich in the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes without moving it, until the bottom is golden brown and crispy. Press down gently with a spatula.

4. **Flip and Finish**
   Carefully flip the sandwich and cook the other side for 3-4 minutes until golden brown and the cheese is fully melted. If the cheese needs more time to melt, reduce heat to low and cover the pan for 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat, let rest for 1 minute, slice diagonally, and serve immediately.
