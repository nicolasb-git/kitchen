### Ingredients
- [ ] 4 cups Mixed Greens
- [ ] 1 cup Cherry Tomatoes, halved
- [ ] 1 Cucumber, sliced
- [ ] 1 Avocado, diced
- [ ] 1/4 Red Onion, thinly sliced
- [ ] 2 tbsp Lemon Juice
- [ ] 3 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- [ ] Salt and Pepper

### Instructions
1. **Prep the Vegetables**
   Wash and dry the mixed greens thoroughly. Slice the cherry tomatoes in half, slice the cucumber into rounds, and dice the avocado.

2. **Make the Dressing**
   In a small jar or bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper until emulsified.

3. **Assemble**
   In a large salad bowl, combine the greens, tomatoes, cucumber, and red onion. Drizzle with half the dressing and toss gently to coat.

4. **Finish and Serve**
   Top with the diced avocado (adding it last prevents it from getting mashed). Drizzle with the remaining dressing and serve immediately.
