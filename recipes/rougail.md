### Ingredients
- [ ] 1.5 lbs Smoked Sausages (or Toulouse sausages)
- [ ] 4 medium Tomatoes, diced
- [ ] 2 large Onions, sliced
- [ ] 3 cloves Garlic, minced
- [ ] 1-2 Fresh Chili Peppers, chopped
- [ ] 2 tbsp Vegetable Oil
- [ ] 1 tbsp Tomato Paste
- [ ] 1 sprig Thyme
- [ ] 1 Bay Leaf
- [ ] Salt and Black Pepper
- [ ] Fresh Parsley or Cilantro for garnish

### Instructions
1. **Prepare the Sausages**
   Cut the sausages into bite-sized pieces (about 2-inch chunks). If using smoked sausages, you can blanch them briefly in boiling water to remove excess salt, then drain.

2. **Sauté the Aromatics**
   Heat oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until softened and translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Add minced garlic and chopped chili peppers, sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

3. **Build the Sauce**
   Add the diced tomatoes and tomato paste to the pan. Stir well and cook for 5 minutes until tomatoes begin to break down. Add thyme and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper.

4. **Simmer and Serve**
   Add the sausage pieces to the sauce and stir to coat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce should thicken and the flavors meld together. Remove bay leaf and thyme sprig. Garnish with fresh herbs and serve hot over white rice.
