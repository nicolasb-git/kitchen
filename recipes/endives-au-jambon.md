- [ ] 30 g flour
- [ ] 20 cl milk
- [ ] 150–200 g raclette cheese, sliced
- [ ] 50 g cream
- [ ] Salt
- [ ] Black pepper

### Instructions

1. **Cook the Endives**  
   Boil the endives in a large pot of water for about 20 minutes. Drain thoroughly to remove excess moisture.

   Place one cooked endive on each slice of ham and roll tightly.

3. **Arrange in the Baking Dish**  
   Place the ham-wrapped endives in a baking dish.

4. **Prepare the Sauce**  
   Melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the flour and stir to form a roux. Gradually add the milk while whisking until smooth. Stir in the cream and season with salt and pepper.

5. **Cover and Top with Raclette**  
   Pour the sauce over the endives and top with slices of raclette cheese.

6. **Bake**  
   Bake in the oven at 200 °C (390 °F) for 30–35 minutes, until the raclette is melted and golden.
