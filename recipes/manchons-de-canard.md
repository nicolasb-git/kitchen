### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Marinade**  
   Preheat the oven to **210°C (410°F)**.  
   In a mixing bowl, combine olive oil, soy sauce (or Maggi seasoning), whole-grain mustard, honey or maple syrup, ketchup, tomato paste, and ground ginger.

2. **Marinate the Duck**  
   Brush the duck wings generously with the marinade using a pastry brush (or your hands).  
   Place them in a baking dish and pour any remaining marinade over them.  
   Marinate for **at least 1 hour**, or up to overnight for deeper flavor.

3. **Roast the Duck – First Side**  
   Place the dish in the oven and roast for **20 minutes**, until the wings begin to caramelize.

4. **Add Potatoes (Optional)**  
   Turn the wings over.  
   If using potatoes, add them now. The rendered duck fat will help cook and flavor them.

5. **Roast the Duck – Second Side**  
   Continue roasting for **20 more minutes**.  
   Depending on your oven, you may need to extend cooking by **5 minutes per side** for deeper caramelization.

6. **Serve**  
   Serve immediately while hot, with the caramelized sauce and optional roasted potatoes.
