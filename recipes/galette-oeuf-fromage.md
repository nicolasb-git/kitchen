### Ingredients
- [ ] 1 Buckwheat Galette (pre-made or homemade)
- [ ] 1 Egg
- [ ] ½ cup Grated Emmental (or Comté or Gruyère)
- [ ] 1 tsp Butter
- [ ] Salt and Black Pepper

### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Galette**  
   Heat a large skillet or crêpe pan over medium heat. Add the butter and let it melt. Place the buckwheat galette flat on the pan.

2. **Add the Egg**  
   Crack the egg in the center of the galette. Let the white begin to set slightly while keeping the yolk intact. Season lightly with salt and pepper.

3. **Add the Cheese**  
   Sprinkle the grated cheese evenly around the egg, avoiding the yolk. Allow the cheese to melt while the egg cooks.

4. **Fold and Serve**  
   Fold the four edges of the galette inward to form a square, leaving the egg yolk visible in the center. Continue cooking until the cheese is fully melted and the galette edges are crisp. Serve immediately.
